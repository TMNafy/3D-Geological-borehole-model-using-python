# 3D-Geological-borehole-model-using-python-Final-year-project-
GemPy is a Python-based, local area driven, open-source geomodelling library. It is equipped for 
developing complex 3D geographical models including different highlights, for example, faults 
structures, unconformities, and fault network, considering underlying powerful implicit approach. 
From the beginning, GemPy was intended to be handily implanted in probabilistic systems for 
leading vulnerability analysis with respect to subsurface structures.


#Pre-requisite 

The pre-requisite skills and knowledge required for various roles is detailed below.
Pre-requisite for Developers
Developers who are going to run the system should be comfortable with the use of 
• Python
• Machine Learning
• Jupyter Notebook
• Need basic knowledge about geology and geological model.

#Requirements

The minimum requirements for running the system required to operate the Gempy are listed 
below:
• Microsoft Windows 10
• Ram 8 GB
• GPU 4 GB
• Internet Connection 
Supported web browsers include
• Mozilla firefox
• Google Chrome

#Installation GemPy

At first need to install the Anaconda version of Python but due to conflictive packages we 
recommended to use mini-conda. Once install the the python we recommend installing the 
Gempy using,
$ conda install gempy
It will automatically install all the related required dependencies.
Theano Installation
Theano does not have pre-installed, the easiest way to install the conda version of Theano. The 
following process:
$ conda install theano
Before using the GemPy, need to confirm installing the given dependencies:
• theano
• pandas
• matplotlib
• numpy
• pyvista
• pytest
• seaborn
• network
• scikit-image
Gempy recommend using Anaconda because it is hassle free and easy to install all the packages.
Jupyter Notebook Installation
To set up the Jupyter notebook, conda environment is very suitable and work properly. The 
following process to install the Jupyter notebook:
$ conda install jupyter notebook
Note
Some packages are already installed in Anaconda which is requires by Theano. If to install all 
the packages in one go does not work properly, we recommend to use mini-conda or older 
version of Anaconda
